        <p>Since I was of small age, I have had a huge passion for technology and programming. I started my journey by learning drag-and-drop at the age of 12 in a software called Plezmo, after that I started coding in MIT App Inventor and its distributions like Niotron, Appzard etc. After that I learnt Java and then I have started making extension for AI2 builders. Along with Java I learnt HTML also and now I am also having some knowledge of css and javascript. Last year I have participated in ATL Marathon and ATL Tinkerprenuer organised by AIM. In ATL Tinkerprenuer I was one of the top 100 participants in all over the India and my position was 21st among 10,000 students. And now I am focussing on Extension and Android Development</p>
