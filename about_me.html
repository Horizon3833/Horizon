            <p class="text-base leading-relaxed xl:w-2/4 lg:w-3/4 mx-auto" style="color: #dfdfdf; width: 90%;">Hello, I am Horizon. So first of all let me tell you why and how I started coding, how coding changed my life. So since I was in class 6th I had a great passion of computers, it wasn't programming it was simple computer like compeleting the homework given by the teacher with full josh. But when I went to class 7th we got lockdown because of the pandemic COVID-19. Our school started online classes as the other schools did and at that time I had a great exposure to the computer. Then one day when attending my computer class my teacher asked students if they have learnt the new things in "Plezmo" and I was stun that what is Plezmo, I asked the teacher and she told me that it is a block coding software when we use to code and it was the first time when I heard the word coding. I asked some of my enthusiastic friends about it and they told me about it. Then in no time I downloaded the Plezmo and started working on it. I learnt plezmo with a very fast pace and soon I discovered a new software named "Scratch" which is basically a block based coding software built by MIT(Massachussets Institute of Technology). I again started working on it and mastered it too. Then we got a competition named ATL Marathon which was organised by the AIM(Atal Innovation Mission). For that I planned to make a consulting app, where patients who want to talk to doctors can talk to them from the application only as it was the time of pandemic and everyone was not willing to go to doctors because of the fear of virus. I started working on Plezmo to make the application and that time I can still remember I named the application as YPD(Your Personal Doctor), but when working on Plezmo the speed of making the app was very slow and it was taking a lot of time, then I went to YouTube and searched for "How to make a chat app in block coding". I searched for Plezmo and Scratch videos for making the chat app but I didn't found any and the first recommendation was of "Coding with Bus" in some "MIT App Inventor", the deadline for the submissions was near and I had to complete the project, then what I did, I copied the whole code the whole UI from the youtube video only and submitted the project. Parallely one of my friend was also working on his project for the same competition and he also done the same thing I did watching the same video on the youtube. We weren't selected in the competition but at that time I got to know about the power of MIT App Inventor. I started working on it and again made big projets in it but it wasn't enough. I got to know that there are some more block based coding softwares and one of the most famous was "Kodular". Again I started working on the Kodular and literally I completed my Chat App there. It was really fully functional with all the functionalites like replying to particular messages, video calling etc. but for that I had used so many extensions in it. Then I thought to make my own extension, but I was having zero knowledge about how to build one. I searched for the YouTube again and got a video by Dreamer's Lab where he tought to make a simple extension named CardView(basically it wasn't usefull because there was already a built-in component with the same name and with more functionalites). I again did the same thing, I copied the whole code he told in the video and made my first extension in Java and uploaded it to the Kodular Community but to be very true I was not even knowing the "J" of "Java". I asked my father to bring some Java book, and he bought one. Then I started learning Java and also Web Development from YouTube by "Code With Harry". Then I also got to know about the other distributions of the MIT App Inventor like Niotron and Appzard, I had a great affinity towards the Niotron as it was purely made in India. I started contributing to the community and also got promoted to the post of Moderator. I really love the Niotron, its community and specially its staff. I started working on extension development after learning a little of Java and made so many extensions, Some were failed but one named TicTacToe Extension was the biggest bomb for my extension development carrier. I think it really got good reviews and at this time I have more that 8k downloads on the <a href="https://getaix.com/" target="_blank">getaix.com</a> website and I guess from the different communites where I had posted my extension I must have got more than 18k downloads. Soon I got to know that MIT App Inventor is a open source project and anyone can contribute to it. I forked the project and clonned the project locally from GitHub to work on it. I started working on it and soon made good UI for it and also added many components to it and also added my extensions there. After that I had stopped working for block coding softwares and have started learning some other languages and SDKs. right now I am working with Flutter and trying to explore its depths as I loved the way to "Code Once and Deploy Everywhere". I have also added the guide for you guys to learn flutter with real fun and hope so you will like it. But after not getting selected in ATL Marathon I didn't left the hope and again submitted my project for ATL Tinkerprenuer and I got selected in top 100 with the All India Rank of 21 and there were about more than 10k submissions, and from then I have participated in different ATL Competitions and got selected in each, last year I again got seleted in the ATL Marathon. If you want to know more about me or wanted some help you can contact me anytime. I'll be there to help you out. One thing I wanted to add is that I live in hostels so maybe sometimes it may take long time for me to reply to your messages. Thank you</p>
